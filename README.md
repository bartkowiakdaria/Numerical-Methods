# 🧮 Numerical Methods Projects in MATLAB

This repository contains two projects developed as part of a **Numerical Methods** course using **MATLAB**.  
Each project demonstrates the implementation of a selected numerical algorithm with analysis and visualizations.  
*All reports and explanations are written in Polish.*

## Project 1: Approximate Integration with Chebyshev Polynomials and the Trapezoidal Rule

This project focuses on **approximate computation of definite integrals** using:
- **Chebyshev polynomial approximation**
- **Trapezoidal rule**

It demonstrates how function approximation can improve the accuracy of numerical integration.
